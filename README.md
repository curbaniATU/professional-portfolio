Welcome to the GitHub for my portfolio site!

This website was made using the following tools:
    EJS
    Node.js
    Express
    MongoDB


This website can also, for the most part act as a template for a portfolio site. With the exception of the contact information, all values can be changed in the mainController.js file and in your MongoDB database to see your own information on the website.

In order to get it up and running follow the below steps:

    1. Install Node.js on your system
    2. Clone the repository in the IDE of your choosing
    3. Run "npm install" to install all dependencies
    4. Configure the variables in the mainController.js file to fit what you need them to
    5. Make appropriate changes to the footer.ejs and contact.ejs pages to fit your needs
    6. Change the link to fit your MongoDB database
    7. Run "nodemon server.js" to see your website
